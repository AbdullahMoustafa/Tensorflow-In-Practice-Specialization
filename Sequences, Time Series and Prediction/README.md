## 1st Week
synthetic data series and performed a prediction on it using statistical methods. This notebook contains a different pattern. See if you can create a similar prediction for it to the one you did in class!

## 2nd week

split a dataset
start training a DNN
Create your own synthetic dataset
Once you have your series, youâ€™ll create a DNN to predict values for that series!


## 3rd week

create the data set then build a model using LSTMs and RNN imporve the deep neural network

## 4th week 

real-world prediction --  dataset from Jason Brownlee, author of the amazing MachineLearningMastery.com site and who has shared lots of datasets at https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets.
dataset of daily minimum temperatures in the city of Melbourne, Australia measured from 1981 to 1990.
