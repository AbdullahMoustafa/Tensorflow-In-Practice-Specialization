# 1st Week
synthetic data series and performed a prediction on it using statistical methods. This notebook contains a different pattern. See if you can create a similar prediction for it to the one you did in class!

# 2nd week

split a dataset
start training a DNN
Create your own synthetic dataset
Once you have your series, youâ€™ll create a DNN to predict values for that series!


# 3rd week

create the data set then build a model using LSTMs and RNN imporve the deep neural network
# 4th week
